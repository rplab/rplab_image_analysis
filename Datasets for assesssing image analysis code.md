# Datasets for assessing image analysis code

File created July 6, 2023

Location
In addition to original data locations, the image sets below are in the lab Dropbox account, in folders in \Zebrafish Image Library


## Gut bacteria, aggregated and planktonic

### AEMB4 invading EN in the zebrafish gut
From Deepika’s experiments of AE-MB4 invasion of EN, in vivo imaging in larval zebrafish.

Original location: On Aragog, Directory Deepika, folder 7_23 (2020)

Location: Copy overall experiment data and Scan 8 folder of Fish 5 to Dropbox, **\ AEMB4_invasion_of_EN_scans\from_Deepika_7_23_20_Fish5**

Include the ExperimentData.txt file for the entire time series (16 scans), not just scan 8.
(May copy other scans later.)
3 regions, two colors: 488 nm (GFP, EN) and 568 nm (dTomato, AE-MB4)
Scan 8: EN planktonic and aggregated, mostly region 2; AE-MB4 visible
A bit blurry, but pretty good.
Size: 11 GB.

## Possible additional sets to upload

### Gut bacteria, aggregated and planktonic

Additional scans from Deepika’s experiments with AE-MB invading EN in the zebrafish gut.
More scans from folder 7_23 (2020), Fish 5
Total (16 scans) 175 GB
Each scan folder, about 11 GB
Scan 1: EN aggregated, mostly region 2
Scan 8: EN planktonic and aggregated, mostly region 2; AE-MB4 visible
Scan 16: planktonic EN, regions 2 and 3; lots of AE-MB4.

Also: Other datasets in 7_23, 7_30, 8_5_20, 8_6,20, 8_7_20, 8_28_20 .

7_30_20; Two fish regions imaged; Fish 4 is a good set;  Scan 2 GFP shows lots of aggregates RFP nothing; Scan 17 shows planktonic GFP, but low image quality

Not previously quantified, I think
